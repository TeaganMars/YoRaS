 dynasties.1.t: "The First Fitna Starts"
 dynasties.1.d: "For centuries, the Syrian and Mashriqi peoples have been enemies. Syrian mercenaries often times joined forces with Roman armies and fought against the Persians with their Mashriqi mercenaries. When Islam spread through the region, a very anti-borders message was spread which helped unify the conquering Caliphate. Now, however, this message is slowly being forgotten. After an assassination of the 3rd Caliph, Uthman, by Egyptian nationalists, The Umayyad dynasty, was not pleased. Mu'awiya, head of the Umayyads, was Uthman's nephew and wished for revenge. The Syrian Muslims went on to murder 4000 suspected seditionists. At first, the Rashidun Caliphate put down the vengeful mob in the Battle of the Camel, but tensions were not eased. Soon enough, Mu'awiya Umayyad revolted again and wanted to not only seek the revenge that was properly due, but also Conquer the Caliphate for himself. In history, this is known as the first Islamic Civil War."

Muawiyah Umayyad has now promised 'Amr ibn Al-'As the governership of Egypt if the first fitna goes in the Umayyad favor. Obviously, 'Amr ibn Al-'As has joined the enemy."

It was her father, who after Muhammad's death, became the first Caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate. Although Aisha was in a movement against the third Caliph, Uthman, she nonetheless saw it cruel to see him assassinated. She wanted revenge and fought in the battle of the Camel, and now joins the Umayyads in the First Fitna."

In the year 61AH, 680AD, he revolted after refusing to submit to the Umayyad rulers because he considered their grab for power illegitimate. The conflict culminated in the Battle of Karbala where Husayn and 71 of his followers were defeated and killed by 30,000 Umayyad soldiers. Becuase of this, the schism between Sunni and Shia was deepened as the Shia considered Husayn ibn Ali a martyr. In fact, the Day of Ashura is celebtrated each year to remember Husayn for his martyrdom."

 dynasties.9.t: "The Abbasid Revolution"
 dynasties.9.d: "The Abbasids were Arabs that descended from the youngest uncle of Muhammad, Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib. It was they who viewed the Umayyads as illegitimate usurpers of the Islamic Caliphate. During the Umayyad Caliphate, the empire grew tremendously along with Islam. There were, however, many growing pains that came along with it. For starters, large parts of the Caliphate rejected Islam and stayed true to their original religion. These groups of people were often marginalized and looked down upon. Worse yet, non-arab muslims were treated the same way. Furthermore, Arab Muslims that lived outside the Arabian peninsula, such as settlers and soldiers, often felt displeased with the Caliphate for largly ignoring them. This caused massive unrest within the Umayyad Caliphate and a large number of people began to back the Abbasids as the true Caliphs of Islam. Now, Abu al-Abbas as-Saffah has begun the Abbasid Revolution, aiming to bring him and his family to power."
 dynasties.9.a: "We will never back down."
 dynasties.10.t: "Abu Muslim joins the Abbasids"
 dynasties.10.d: "Abu Muslim originally started as a general in the Umayyad Caliphate who proved his worth during the Third Fitna. Soon after, he showed incredible ability in politics, persuading Shias, Sunnis, Zoroastrians, Jews, and Christians to rally under him. After being appointed governer of Syria and Egypt by the Umayyads, he continued to grow in power. Not pleased with the development, The Umayyad Caliphate attempted to assassinate Abu Muslim, to which he responded by fully supporting the Abbasids' claim on the throne."

 dynasties.12.t: "The Mesopotamian Phase"
 dynasties.12.d: "By 750, the Abbasid armies had moved into Mesopotamia, crushing all Umayyad forces that they run in to. During the siege of Wasit, As-Saffah was crowned the new Abbasid Caliph, discrediting the Umayyads further. By April of that year, Damascus had fallen and the majority of the Umayyad family members were tracked down and killed in Egypt. By July, after three years of rebellion, the Umayyad Caliphate was no more."
 dynasties.12.a: "This isn't looking good for us."
 dynasties.13.t: "Debate to End Arabization"
 dynasties.13.d: "During the Abbasid Revolution, a debate was sparked amongst the leading Arab aristocracy. One of the major gripes with members of the Abbasid revolution was the intolerance towards non-Arab cultures, especially that of the Persians. Some suggest that we end our policy of Arabization, and begin to include other cultures in our country."

 dynasties.14.d: "One of the many gripes that people have with our Caliphate is our marganilzation of non-Muslim citizens. This has caused massive favor towards the Abbasids' revolt. Now, the elite of our nation have begun to wonder if accepting more heathens into our ranks would be beneficial. It would destabalize our realm in the short term, but help out by lowering support for the Abbasid pretenders."

 dynasties.18.t: "Surrender to the Abbasids"
 dynasties.18.d: "After years and years of fighting, the Abbasids have not given up on their claim to the Caliphate. As our manpower dwindles into nonexistence, the Abbasids seem to be making more and more gains. Perhaps, as some of the elite whisper behind our backs, it is time to cut our losses and surrender to the Abbasids. Perhaps it is in the interest of the people to end this bloody civil war."

With this, the Umayyad Caliphate ended and the Abbasid Caliphate began. Across the next few centuries, the Abbasid Caliphate would make room for Islam's Golden Age, developing literature, math, and science greatly. Baghdad would become the center of the world and continue to be a marvel of its time until the sacking of it by the Mongols in the mid 13th century. Although Arabic continued to be the main language of government, many local provinces had cultural and religious freedom, decreasin unrest throughout the empire.

Ruqqayah, daughter of Muhammad, married the third Rashidun Caliph, Uthman ibn Affan, whose great grandfather was Umayyad ibn Abd Shams. The Umayyads rose to power following the First Fitna in which the Rashidun Caliphate crumbled and the Umayyad Caliphate was born. The Umayyads held power from 661 to 750, but controlled the Iberian penninsula until 1031.

They continued to be the religious head of Sunni Muslims, but were under the control of the Mamluk Sultanate from 1261 until the Ottoman conquest of Egypt in 1517. The Abbasids are known for the massive policy shift that occured within the Muslim world. Non-Arabs and Non-Muslims, although not treated as complete equals, gained more rights to Arab Muslims.

In the 9th century, the Qur'an was first translated into Persian converting much of the masses. Unfortunately, this also lead to their downfall as the Turks were converted to Islam and soon created their own rival dynasty, the Ghaznavids, who would eventually conquer the Samanid Empire.

They later became governers of Baghdad and kept the position from 820 to 891. The dynasty ended after Tahir's son, Muhammad ibn Tahir proved to be extremely incompetent in governence. Eventually, the people revolted, allowing the Saffarids to come in and take the majority of the territory. The Baghdad branch was removed from power after a civil war in which the Tahirids aided the losing side and were removed from power shortly after the war.

In 1212, however, the Almohad Caliphate lost the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa, essentially ending their rule in Iberia. By 1248, nearly all the possesions of the Almohads would be taken in Iberia. At the same time, The Almohads suffered from rebellions in North Africa, each taking small pieces away from the Caliphate. This paved way for the Marinids to rebel in 1215 and conquer nearly all of the lands of the Almohad Dynasty. The Last Almohad ruler died in 1269, being murdered by a slave in Marrakesh."

This, however, did not stop the independence movement as two more insurrections, in 761 and 768, occured, but with little success. Finally, in 777 Abd ar-Rahmān ibn Rustam, who was one of the four original missionaries, was elected Imam. Unlike other Ibadi Imamets, this Imamete was hereditary. The justification was that Abd ar-Rahmān ibn Rustam came from no tribe, being of Persian descent, and thus would show no biase towards any of the Berber tribes in the area. From there, the Rustamids controlled the area around Tlemcen until 909 when they were defeated by the newly formid Fatimid Caliphate."
